# Burger-Town

## Purpose

The purpose of the app was for me to continue to develop my skills with NodeJS by using Express, Express Handlebars, MySQL, and Heroku.

## How to use

You can find the app by following the link to the deployed version on Heroku.

Initial start of the page loads in a number of burgers pre-populated into the database.

The use can then click on a button to "Devour" the burger.

Utilizing jQuery and Express, the app convert the devoured burgers into another column and change the button to "Back on the Menu".

Users can also add their own burgers that a defaulted to be put on the menu.
